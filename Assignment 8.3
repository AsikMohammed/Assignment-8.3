Architecture of Apache Hadoop Yarn: 
    Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storage and large-scale processing of data-sets on clusters of commodity hardware.

The YARN Infrastructure (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is the framework responsible for providing the computational resources 
(e.g., CPUs, memory, etc.) needed for application executions. Two important elements are:

Resource Manager:
    The Resource Manager (one per cluster) is the master. It knows where the slaves are located (Rack Awareness) and how many resources they 
have. It runs several services, the most important is the Resource Scheduler which decides how to assign the resources.The ResourceManager 
has two main components: Scheduler and ApplicationsManager.

Scheduler: 

    * The Scheduler is responsible for allocating resources to the various running applications subject to familiar constraints of 
      capacities, queues etc. 
    * The Scheduler is pure scheduler in the sense that it performs no monitoring or tracking of status for the application. Also, it offers 
      no guarantees about restarting failed tasks either due to application failure or hardware failures. 
    * The Scheduler performs its scheduling function based the resource requirements of the applications.

There are three types of schedulers.They are,
                     
                     1) FIFO
                     2) Capacity Scheduler
                     3) Fair Scheduler

    * The FIFO Scheduler places applications in a queue and runs them in the order of submission.
    * The Capacity Scheduler has a separate dedicated queue that allows the small job to start as soon as it is submitted.
    * In Fair Scheduler, there is no need to reserve a set amount of capacity, since it will dynamically balance resources between all running jobs. 

Node Manager:    
    The Node Manager (many per cluster) is the slave of the infrastructure. When it starts, it announces himself to the Resource Manager. 
Periodically, it sends an heartbeat to the Resource Manager. Each Node Manager offers some resources to the cluster. At run-time, the Resource 
Scheduler will decide how to use this capacity: a Container is a fraction of the NM capacity and it is used by the client for running a program.

In YARN, there are at least three actors:

     * The Job Submitter (the client)
     * The Resource Manager (the master)
     * The Node Manager (the slave)

The application startup process is the following:

    a.) A client submits an application to the Resource Manager
    b.) The Resource Manager allocates a container
    c.) The Resource Manager contacts the related Node Manager
    d.) The Node Manager launches the container
    e.) The Container executes the Application Master
